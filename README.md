# How does it work?
TeleDrive watches a folder for changes and automatically uploads any files contained within that folder to Telegram's saved messages. TeleDrive tags sub folders with their names, so when you restore your files using TeleDrive, you automatically get your folder structure back. For e.x if a TeleDrive's synced folder contains two sub folders, each containing one file:

```
TeleDriveSync ---- ----- Folder1 ----- MyFile1.txt
                 |
                 |
                 |
                 | ----- Folder2 ----- MyFile2.txt

```

Then TeleDrive will upload your files with the following tags:

- #TeleDrive /Folder1/MyFile1.txt
- #TeleDrive /Folder2/MyFile2.txt

This preserves your folder structure, even in a chat like Telegram's saved messages - This means that when you restore your files, you get the exact same folder structure back.

```
TeleDriveSync ---- ----- Folder1 ----- MyFile1.txt
                 |
                 |
                 |
                 | ----- Folder2 ----- MyFile2.txt
```
